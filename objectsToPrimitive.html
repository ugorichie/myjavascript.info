///////////////----- Objects can have mathematical operations carried out on them but first they have to be converted to PRIMITIVES for this to happen. This simply means we can have (Obj1 + Obj2) , which is naturally impossible . but if converted to PRIMITIVE DATATYPE, the its possinle and the RESULTS would be a PRIMITIVE DATATYPE.


       //NB: you CANNOT convert an Object to primitive BOOLEAN because all Objects are TRUE.

       //NB: Numeric conversions occur when we do any mathematical operation on two(2) objects. its as simple as that --- (Once you minus or add or multiply or divide any Object from another Object, it is automatically converted to a primitive datatype).
