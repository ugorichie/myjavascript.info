     // There’s a background process in the JavaScript engine that is called garbage collector. It monitors all objects and removes those that have become unreachable.
     // A simple example

        // Here’s the simplest example:

            // user has a reference to the object
            let user = {
            name: "John"
            }; 

            user = null;
            //this would garbage in (name: "John")
